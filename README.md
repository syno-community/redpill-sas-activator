# SAS Driver Activator


## Purpose
This small script-only extension which loads SAS drivers which are already shipped with the OS, even if the platform
doesn't indicate native SAS support.


## Installation
Use `ext-manager.sh add 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedPill-TTG/redpill-sas-activator/master/rpext-index.json'` 
to add the module to your image.
